# Discord-ui

Discord-ui is a replica of the Discord interface written with :

- **[Svelte](https://svelte.dev)**
- **[SvelteKit](https://sveltekit.com)**
- **[Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com)**

This project was created to learn Svelte and Tailwind. It is not meant to be a production-ready application.

I may reuse it and change the content to transform it into an original portefolio, useful to demonstrate my skills and projects.

The project is hosted on GitHub and the page can be viewed on vercel [here](https://discord-ui-herbemalveillante.vercel.app)
